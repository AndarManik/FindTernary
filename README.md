# FindTernary
Help find a Ternary Operation Network

A Ternary Operation Network can be constructed using a BiasManager
which stores a bias array for each opeartion

The goal is to create a BiasManager which can gets a score of 
less than 0.01 for the average error as well as the operation with the max error.

Running main in trainEnv will start a console prompt to train a network with {2, 12, 12, 1}
